# Optimal Transport project
This project is a PyTorch implementation of [Improving GANs using Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05573.pdf), for the course on Optimal Transport taught by Marco Cuturi at ENSAE.

The code is formatted as a [notebook](https://github.com/chrlsrx/optimal-transport-project/blob/main/ot_project_OTGAN.ipynb). We also invite you to read the [report](https://github.com/chrlsrx/optimal-transport-project/blob/main/Report_ot_gan.pdf). It summarizes the motivations for OT-GAN, as well as the results of our experiments.
